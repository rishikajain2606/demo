        Angular is an open-source, JavaScript framework written in TypeScript. Google maintains it, and its primary purpose
        is to develop single-page applications. As a framework, Angular has clear advantages while also providing a standard
        structure for developers to work with. It enables users to create large applications in a maintainable manner.
        “Angular” is the catch-all term for the various framework versions out there. Angular was developed in 2009, and as
        a result, there have been many iterations.
    
        First, there was the original Angular, called Angular 1 and eventually known as AngularJS. Then came Angulars 2, 3,
        4, 5, until finally, the current version, Angular 11, released on 11/11/2020. Each subsequent Angular version
        improves on its predecessor, fixing bugs, addressing issues, and accommodating increasing complexity of current
        platforms.
    
        If you want to design apps better suited for mobile devices, and/or more complex apps, you had best to upgrade to
        its current version.</p>
